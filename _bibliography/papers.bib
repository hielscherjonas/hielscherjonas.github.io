abstract = {Security awareness is big business – virtually every organization in the Western world provides some form of awareness or training, mostly bought from external vendors. However, studies and industry reports show that these programs have little to no effect in terms of changing the security behavior of employees. We explain the conditions that enable behavior change, and identify one significant blocker in the implementation phase: not disabling existing (insecure) routines – failure to take out the trash – prevents embedding of new (secure) routines. Organizational Psychology offers the paradigm Intentional Forgetting (IF) and associated tools for replacing old (insecure) behaviors with new (secure) ones by identifying and eliminating different cues (sensoric, routine-based, time and space based as well as situational strength cues) that trigger old behavior. We introduce the underlying theory, examples of successful application in safety contexts, and show how its application leads to effective behavior change by reducing the information that needs to be transmitted to employees, and suppressing obsolete routines.},

abstract = {Misconceptions about digital security and privacy topics in the general public frequently lead to insecure behavior. However, little is known about the prevalence and extent of such misconceptions in a global context. In this work, we present the results of the first large-scale survey of a global population on misconceptions: We conducted an online survey with n = 12, 351&nbsp;participants in 12&nbsp;countries on four continents. By investigating influencing factors of misconceptions around eight common security and privacy topics (including E2EE, Wi-Fi, VPN, and malware), we find the country of residence to be the strongest estimate for holding misconceptions. We also identify differences between non-Western and Western countries, demonstrating the need for region-specific research on user security knowledge, perceptions, and behavior. While we did not observe many outright misconceptions, we did identify a lack of understanding and uncertainty about several fundamental privacy and security topics.},
