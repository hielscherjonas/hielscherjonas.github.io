Hey, I am Jonas, a cybersecurity researcher specializing in __Human-Centered Security__. I currently work as a Postdoc at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en)[@MaxLab](https://group.cispa.io/golla). I received my PhD from [Ruhr University Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/en/).

My research interests include:
* Human-Centred Security (HCS) Research in Organizations
* Economics of Cybersecurity
* Socio-Technical System Security
* Usable Security
* Industrial Control System Security


My research is regularly published at top-tier security and computer science venues, such as USENIX Security, IEEE SP, ACM CCS, ISOC NDSS, and ACM CHI. See [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UvcKg4kAAAAJ) for an overview of my publications.

Please [reach out](mailto:firstname.lastname@cispa.de), if you would like to collaborate in any of those areas.
